# Crawling Educational Websites

<p><b>ABSTRACT</b></p><br/><br/>

<p>Internet, the hub of capacious and diverse data, has become a vital part of our lives. With an immense amount of data available on the internet, web mining has emerged as a significant area of research due to its wide range applications. The term web mining was coined by Etzioni in the year of 1996[#singhweb]. Web mining mainly of three types -Web Content Mining, Web Structure Mining and Web Usage mining. Web Content Mining is the process of extracting useful information from the contents of Web documents. Web Structure Mining can be defined as the process of discovering structural information from the Web links and semantics. Web Usage Mining is the discovery of meaningful patterns from data generated by client-server transactions on one or more Web localities. This paper includes an overview of Web Mining and its application in crawling the semantic web for various topics and creating the database for the same. It extracts the links from the web and includes only the “.edu” links as an html file which can be used by the fellow researchers for their task.</p><br/><br/>

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p><br/><br/>

<p>A Web crawler, also known as a spider, is an Internet bot that systematically browses WWW, typically for the purpose of Web indexing (or web spidering). Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content of others site's web content.<br>
Crawlers consume resources on the systems they visit and often visit sites without approval and authorization. Issues of “schedule”, “load”, and “politeness” come into play when large collections of HTML pages are accessed. Mechanisms exists for public sites not wishing to be crawled to make this known to the crawling agent[3].<br>
The number of pages on the internet is large, even the largest inter domain crawlers fall short of making a complete index. Only 40% of the HTML pages have been indexed by Page Rank Crawler (or the crawler used by Google). For that reason search engines were bad at giving relevant search
results in the early years of the WWW or before the year 2000. This is improved greatly by modern search engines; nowadays relevant results are given almost instantly due to large servers kept by tech giants like Google or Microsoft. Almost 90% of the data have been cached by Google (the pages they have crawled up-til now).<br></p>
